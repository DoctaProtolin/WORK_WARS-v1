WORK OUT!!!!!!

IN THE YEAR, 2025. . .

A WORKERS DISPUTE BETWEEN THE FACTION OF CARPENTERS AND THE FACTION OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS AND HAS LED TO A TROUBLING SITUATION. . .

TRADITIONALLY THE TWO SIDES GOT ALONG, COLLABORATING ON LARGE ARCHITECTURAL PROJECTS, UNTIL. . .

WHAM!

THE CONSTRUCTION UNION, SIMPLY KNOWN AS "BLOCKMEN", CREATED THE BOTMEN! HIGH POWER ROBOS WHO'D PUT THE CARPENTERS, SIMPLY KNOWN AS "PENMEN", OUT OF WORK IN A JIFFY!

THEIR NEW FACTORY COMPLEX WAS THE BREEDING GROUND FOR THIS NEW UNBEATABLE EVIL, AND SO IT MUST BE STOPPED!

THE PENMEN, UPSET OVER THIS TOPICAL ISSUE, DECIDED TO FIGHT BACK!!!

TAKE OVER THE ROADS, THE TOWNS, AND THE FACTORY, PENMEN! FIGHT THE MEN, FORKS, AND BOTS!!!

====================== CONSTRUCTION MANUAL ===========================

Use the arrow keys to move your cursor.
Press z when selecting a PENMAN to control its actions.
Stuck? Press Z! Seriously, works every time.

Never be afraid to ATTACK a forest to harvest BRICKS. You never know when they'll come in handy.
You can place BRICKS on any adjacent square.
You can also attack BRICKS to pick them up again!


Place a penman on a TOWN to regain health!

Only PENMEN can capture SWITCHES. FORKLIFTS can't.

Complete all maps to recieve the ultimate reward!

======================= TRICKS OF THE TRADE ===========================

The penmen have a few secrets about the blockmen they learned from working with them all those years, such as:

1. The BLOCKMEN are a powerful force, but you can outsmart them with some good ol' PENMAN thought.
2. The penman researchers did lots of work to compile a dictionary of what tiles can do what. Use this for a strategic advantage!
