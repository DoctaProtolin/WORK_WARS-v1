WORK OUT!!!!!!<br>

IN THE YEAR, 2025. . .<br><br>

A WORKERS DISPUTE BETWEEN THE FACTION OF CARPENTERS AND THE FACTION OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS AND HAS LED TO A TROUBLING SITUATION. . .<br><br>

TRADITIONALLY THE TWO SIDES GOT ALONG, COLLABORATING ON LARGE ARCHITECTURAL PROJECTS, UNTIL. . .<br>

WHAM!<br><br>

THE CONSTRUCTION UNION, SIMPLY KNOWN AS "BLOCKMEN", CREATED THE BOTMEN! HIGH POWER ROBOS WHO'D PUT THE CARPENTERS, SIMPLY KNOWN AS "PENMEN", OUT OF WORK IN A JIFFY!<br><br>

THEIR NEW FACTORY COMPLEX WAS THE BREEDING GROUND FOR THIS NEW UNBEATABLE EVIL, AND SO IT MUST BE STOPPED!<br><br>

THE PENMEN, UPSET OVER THIS TOPICAL ISSUE, DECIDED TO FIGHT BACK!!!<br><br>

TAKE OVER THE ROADS, THE TOWNS, AND THE FACTORY, PENMEN! FIGHT THE MEN, FORKS, AND BOTS!!!<br><br>

====================== CONSTRUCTION MANUAL ===========================<br><br>

Use the arrow keys to move your cursor.<br>
Press z when selecting a PENMAN to control its actions.<br>
Stuck? Press Z! Seriously, works every time.<br>

Never be afraid to ATTACK a forest to harvest BRICKS. You never know when they'll come in handy.<br>
You can place BRICKS on any adjacent square.<br>
You can also attack BRICKS to pick them up again!<br><br><br>


Place a penman on a TOWN to regain health!<br><br>

Only PENMEN can capture SWITCHES. FORKLIFTS can't.<br><br>

Complete all maps to recieve the ultimate reward!<br><br>

======================= TRICKS OF THE TRADE ===========================<br><br>

The penmen have a few secrets about the blockmen they learned from working with them all those years, such as:<br><br>

1. The BLOCKMEN are BLOCKHEADS! Outsmart them with some good ol' fashioned PENMAN thought!<br>
2. Split up the PENMEN to split up the BLOCKMEN, divide and conquer!<br>
3. The penman researchers did lots of work to compile a dictionary of what tiles can do what. Use this for a strategic advantage!<br><br>
